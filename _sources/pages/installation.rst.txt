Installation
============

SImMER is meant to be a well-tested code across multiple operating systems. However, Windows testing is yet to be implemented, so installation may be especially buggy for Windows users.

.. note:: SImMER is currently a private, beta code. If you would like access, please contact Arjun Savel at asavel@berkeley.edu.


Installing from source
-----------

SImMER is developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/arjunsavel/shane-reduction>`_. If you received the code as a tarball, skip to below the git clone line.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install -U setuptools setuptools_scm pep517
    git clone https://github.com/arjunsavel/shane-reduction.git
    cd shane-reduction
    python -m pip install -e .


Test the installation
---------------------

To ensure that the installation has been performed smoothly, feel free to run the unit and integration tests included with the package. The entire test suite should take on the order of 10 minutes to run. From the shane-reduction directory, run

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m unittest discover src
